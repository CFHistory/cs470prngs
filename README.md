# cs470prngs
Repository for group project for CS 470 of Spring 2019

OVERVIEW
	We have three different prng algorithms we use to generate random values. They are detailed as follows in the section below.

	Middlesquare
	

	LCG

	Threefry

GENERATING VALUES
	By default, the final deliverable version of this project comes with the CATOUT flag enabled in each .c file. 
    
	

RUNNING OUR TEST SUITE


TIMING

Given the extensive timing tests that we have run on our algorithms, we do not believe that timing is essential to understanding our project. However, if you would like to report the time of any of our algorithms, simply ensure that at the top of the related .c file, the CATOUT define is commented.
